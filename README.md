# WeatherApp
An app that allows you to input a city and country and the app will return weather data from that location
# Description
A project I made for fun, while learing a bit of react. Inputting a city and town and then pressing the "get weather" button returns weather data from that city.
If the city and country dont match, program will prioritize the city. If there is no city by given name or its laking from the api, program will output nothing.
Trying to press the button while either of the fields are empty will give an error.
